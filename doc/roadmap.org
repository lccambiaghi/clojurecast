* Understand and leverage benefits of using Clojure instead of R
- Study tech.ml suite and pipelines
- Big datasets with lazy seq?
- Safe concurrency? Fast parallelization?
   
* Data wrangling
- Load datasets
- Manipulate data
  + Cast dtypes
  + NA values
  + Filter, groupby
- Build tsibble, i.e. choose index, key and response
  + Are dtypes converted correctly?
  + What about exogenous data?

* Modelling
- Split in train/val/test
  + datetime slicing is easy with ~dplyr.filter~
- Select models
  + Ensembles
- Compute cross-validation score
- Out-of-sample forecast
